## üßæ Abstract
This project presents a **dual-axis solar tracking system** using the **PIC18F microcontroller** and a **GPS module**. The system calculates the **real-time position of the sun** (elevation and azimuth) using trigonometric formulas derived from GPS data (latitude, longitude, and UTC time). Two **stepper motors** control the solar panel‚Äôs tilt and rotation to maintain optimal sunlight exposure throughout the day. The design ensures improved solar efficiency, energy harvesting, and automation without the need for external light sensors.

## ü™ê 1. Introduction
Solar tracking is a method to orient solar panels toward the sun to maximize energy generation. Traditional fixed solar panels face energy loss due to varying sunlight angles.  
This project aims to develop an **automated, precise, and reliable solar tracking system** based on **GPS and astronomical calculations**, eliminating the dependency on light-dependent resistors (LDRs).

## üéØ 2. Objectives
- To design and implement a **dual-axis solar tracker** using a PIC18F microcontroller.  
- To extract **latitude, longitude, and time** from GPS data.  
- To calculate **solar elevation and azimuth** using trigonometric functions.  
- To control **two stepper motors** for accurate sun alignment.  
- To optimize the **power capture** of solar panels dynamically.

## üß≠ 4. System Overview
The GPS module sends NMEA data to the microcontroller. The program parses this data to obtain date, time, latitude, and longitude. Using solar position equations, it computes the **solar declination, hour angle, elevation, and azimuth**. The calculated values are converted into stepper motor steps, which rotate the solar panel along **two axes** ‚Äî elevation and azimuth.

## üßÆ 7. Algorithm / Pseudocode
```text
BEGIN
  Initialize ports, UART, timers
  WHILE (1)
    READ GPS NMEA data
    PARSE latitude, longitude, UTC time
    CALCULATE day_of_year()
    COMPUTE solar_declination(), solar_hour_angle()
    FIND sun_position (elevation, azimuth)
    CONVERT angles ‚Üí motor steps
    MOVE elevation and azimuth motors

# üß† 8. Code Explanation

## üß© 8.1 Initialization

```c
void InitMain() {
  UART_Init(9600);     // Start serial communication with GPS module
  TRISB = 0x00;        // Set PORTB as output for stepper motor control
  PORTB = 0x00;        // Initialize motor pins to LOW
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The UART is initialized at **9600 baud** to communicate with the GPS module.  
- `TRISB = 0x00` configures all **PORTB pins as outputs**.  
- The output pins are used to send **step sequences** to the stepper motor driver.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 8.2 Reading and Parsing GPS Data

```c
void READ_PARSE_STORE_GPS_DATA() {
  char nmea[80];
  Read_GPS_String(nmea);     // Read the NMEA sentence from GPS
  Parse_NMEA(nmea);          // Extract latitude, longitude, time, date
}
```

**Explanation:**
- GPS sends NMEA sentences like `$GPRMC,HHMMSS,A,lat,N,lon,E,...`.  
- The program reads this string and separates values to store **latitude, longitude, and UTC time**.  
- This data is later used in **solar position calculations**.

## üåû 8.3 Calculating Solar Position

```c
void calc_sun_position() {
  day = day_of_year(date);
  declination = solar_declination(day);
  hour_angle = solar_hour_angle(time, longitude);
  elevation = calc_elevation(latitude, declination, hour_angle);
  azimuth = calc_azimuth(latitude, declination, hour_angle);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The **day of the year** determines the Earth‚Äôs position in orbit.  
- Solar declination is computed using the formula:  
  `23.45 * sin(360 * (284 + n) / 365)`  
- **Hour angle** converts time into angular displacement of the sun.  
- **Elevation** and **azimuth** represent the sun‚Äôs direction relative to the observer.

## üîÅ 8.4 Motor Movement Logic

```c
void moveElevation(int steps, int direction) {
  for (int i = 0; i < steps; i++) {
    setElevationStep(i % 4);
    __delay_ms(10);
  }
}

void moveAzimuth(int steps, int direction) {
  for (int i = 0; i < steps; i++) {
    setAzimuthStep(i % 4);
    __delay_ms(10);
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The motors are moved in small steps using a **4-step sequence** (half-step/full-step).  
- **Direction** is handled by the order of stepping.  
- Each step moves the panel by a small angular increment (e.g., **1.8¬∞ per step**).

## üè† 8.5 Home Position Check

```c
void goHome() {
  while (!limitSwitchPressed()) {
    moveAzimuth(1, BACKWARD);
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The tracker uses a **limit switch** to reset the solar panel to its home position.  
- This ensures the system starts from a **known reference angle** after each reset or restart.
