## üßæ Abstract
This project presents a **dual-axis solar tracking system** using the **PIC18F microcontroller** and a **GPS module**. The system calculates the **real-time position of the sun** (elevation and azimuth) using trigonometric formulas derived from GPS data (latitude, longitude, and UTC time). Two **stepper motors** control the solar panel‚Äôs tilt and rotation to maintain optimal sunlight exposure throughout the day. The design ensures improved solar efficiency, energy harvesting, and automation without the need for external light sensors.

## ü™ê 1. Introduction
Solar tracking is a method to orient solar panels toward the sun to maximize energy generation. Traditional fixed solar panels face energy loss due to varying sunlight angles.  
This project aims to develop an **automated, precise, and reliable solar tracking system** based on **GPS and astronomical calculations**, eliminating the dependency on light-dependent resistors (LDRs).

## üéØ 2. Objectives
- To design and implement a **dual-axis solar tracker** using a PIC18F microcontroller.  
- To extract **latitude, longitude, and time** from GPS data.  
- To calculate **solar elevation and azimuth** using trigonometric functions.  
- To control **two stepper motors** for accurate sun alignment.  
- To optimize the **power capture** of solar panels dynamically.

## üß≠ 4. System Overview
The GPS module sends NMEA data to the microcontroller. The program parses this data to obtain date, time, latitude, and longitude. Using solar position equations, it computes the **solar declination, hour angle, elevation, and azimuth**. The calculated values are converted into stepper motor steps, which rotate the solar panel along **two axes** ‚Äî elevation and azimuth.
